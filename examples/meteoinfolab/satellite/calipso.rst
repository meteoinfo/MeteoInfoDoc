CALIPSO data
*******************

NASA launched the CloudSat and the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation 
(CALIPSO) spacecraft to study the role that clouds and aerosols play in regulating Earth's weather, 
climate and air quality. On April 28, 2006. This example illustrates how to access and visualize a
LaRC CALIPSO data file.

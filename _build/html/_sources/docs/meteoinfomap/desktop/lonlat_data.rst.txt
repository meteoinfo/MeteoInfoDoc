Lon/Lat Station Data
************************

The station ASCII data with longitude and latitude columns could be plotted in MeteoInfo. 
The data should be comma-delimited. The file must contain column titles as the first row. 
The first column must be station identifier (name or code), and the second column must be 
longitude, and the third column must be latitude. The file could contain many columns.

Open the data file with ‘Lon/Lat Stations’ menu, and select ‘Draw Type’ to ‘Station_Info’. Then 
click ‘Draw Data’ button to create a station layer with all columns as attribute data.

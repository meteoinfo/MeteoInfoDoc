************************
Main GUI
************************

The main form of MeteoInfo contains menus, tools, status, a layer control, a map view and a 
layout view. The contents of the layers will be showed in map view. In layout view also legend, 
title, scale bar, north arraw and grid labels could be showed.

In MeteoInfo, the data were arranged with layers. All layers saved as files and the setting of 
MapView and Layout could be saved as a project file (.mip). The layer created from meteorological 
data only exists in memory. It can be saved as a shape file and then could be saved as a layer 
in the project file.

When MeteoInfo started, a default project file ‘Default.mip’ will be loaded.

Mask Out
************************

Mask layer could be set to avoid drawing graphic outside the mask extent. Tick ``Is Maskout`` 
property, and then select a mask layer from ``Layer Name`` list. But firstly you have to have 
at least one mask layer in the project. Only polygon layer could be used as mask layer. 
``china.shp`` file in ``Map`` folder under the software installation path can be used. Open it, 
and then select it in ``Layer Name`` list. Donâ€™t use very complex polygon layer as mask layer, 
it will slow down the software obviously.

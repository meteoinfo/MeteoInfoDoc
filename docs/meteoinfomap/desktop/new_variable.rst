A simple math parser function is included, so user can get a new variable by inputting a formula 
including existing variables. For example, a new wind speed variable can be created from existing 
‘U’ and ‘V variables by the formula ‘sqrt(U*U+V*V)’.

Supported operators are: ‘+’, ‘-’, ‘*’, ‘/’, ‘%’, ‘^’.

Supported functions are: ‘abs’, ‘acos’, ‘asin’, ‘atan’, ‘cos’, ‘exp’, ‘log’, ‘log10’, ‘sin’, 
‘sqrt’, ‘tan’.

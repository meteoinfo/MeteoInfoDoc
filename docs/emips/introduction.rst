Introduction
*******************

Emission Inventory Processing System (EMIPS) is a toolbox of MeteoInfoLab. The purpose of EMIPS is to convert
the emission inventory data to the model ready emission data of air quality models (AQM). Emission inventories
are typically available with gridded annual or monthly emission values for each emissions source. In order to
meet the AQM's requirement of hourly emission data at certain spatial resolution with a special chemical
mechanism, EMIPS is used to transfer an emission inventory data through temporal allocation, spatial
allocation and chemical speciation. More information of EMIPS can be found in examples and source code.
